# Personal Loan Application Technical Test

Welcome to the **Personal Loan Application** backend technical test! This project is designed to assess your ability to build a backend application using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **PostgreSQL** while implementing features for user authentication, loan management, and loan payments. The app should also be containerized using **Docker**.

---

## Context

You will develop a backend API that:

1. Allows users to register and apply for personal loans.
2. Allows authenticated users to manage their loans and make payments.
3. Includes payments management, loan balance tracking, and loan history.

Your solution should demonstrate your expertise in:

- Backend development using **Node.js**.
- API design and implementation.
- Database design and management with **PostgreSQL**.
- Dockerization of the application for easy deployment.
- Writing modular, clean, and testable code.

---

## Requirements

### Core Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication**

   - Users must be able to register by providing their `name`, `email`, and `password`.
   - Authentication should be implemented using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
   - Secured endpoints should be accessible only to authenticated users.

2. **Loan Management**

   - Users should be able to:
     - Apply for a loan by specifying:
       - Loan amount.
       - Purpose of the loan.
       - Duration of the loan (in months).
     - View the status of their loans.
     - Loan statuses: **Pending**, **Approved**, or **Rejected**.
   - An endpoint should allow a loan's status to be updated to **Approved** or **Rejected** (e.g., simulating administrative approval).

3. **Payments Management**

   - Users must be able to make payments toward their loan balance.
   - Payment details should include:
     - Loan ID.
     - Amount paid.
     - Payment date.
   - The loan's updated remaining balance should be calculated and stored after each payment.
   - A user's loan payment history should be retrievable via an API endpoint.

4. **Summary of Loan Details**
   - Users should be able to retrieve:
     - Loan total amount.
     - Total paid so far.
     - Remaining balance.
     - Loan status.

| `amount`            | Float        | Total loan amount.                               |
| `purpose`           | String       | Purpose of the loan.                             |
| `duration`          | Integer      | Loan duration in months.                         |
| `status`            | String       | Loan status (`Pending`, `Approved`, `Rejected`). |
| `total_paid`        | Float        | Sum of all payments.                             |

| `loan_id`      | Integer (FK) | Foreign key referencing a loan.            |
| `amount_paid`  | Float        | Payment amount.                            |
| `payment_date` | Date         | Date of payment.                           |
| `created_at`   | Timestamp    | Timestamp of when this record was created. |

## Documentation

### **Prerequisites**

- Docker: latest
- Node.js: 18+
- PostgreSQL: 14+

---

### **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MenuMarino/mid-senior-test.git
cd mid-senior-test
```

---

### **Setup Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
# Database configuration
DB_USER=user            # Database username (must match docker-compose.yml)
DB_PASSWORD=password    # Database password (must match docker-compose.yml)
DB_HOST=db              # Docker service name
DB_PORT=5432            # Default PostgreSQL port
DB_NAME=personal_loan   # Database name

# Server configuration
PORT=5000               # Optional. Default is 5000

# JWT configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-secret  # Secret to create the JWTs

# Default admin
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
```

If port `5000` is already in use by another service on your machine, update docker-compose.yml to use a different local port. For example, change it to `5001`:

```yaml
ports:
  - '5001:5000'
```

---

### **Start the application**

Run the following command to start the containers:

```bash
docker compose --profile dev up --build -d
```

### **Run Tests**

Run the following command to start the containers:

```bash
docker compose --profile test up --build -d
```

---

### **Verify the API is running**

Once the containers are up, test if the backend is working.

#### **Test the API:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000
```

If you changed the port (e.g., `5001`), run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001
```

#### **Expected message:**

```json
{ "message": "Personal Loan Application is running!" }
```

### **Logging**

If you want to see the logs, you can execute the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it personal_loan_app cat logs/app.log
```
